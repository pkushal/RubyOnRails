rails new sample_app -T // this -T will prevent rails from creating the test directory as we
want to use our own testing thing

Make changes to your gem file if you need to
In this project, I added

group :development do
	gem 'rspec-rails', '3.1.0'
end


group :test do
	gem 'rspec', '3.1.0'
end

to the gem file



Then run bundle install
rails generate rspec:install  // to install some file for rspec

Now edit the .gitignore file as required and do the git.

In the new cmd, do rails s to run the server so that you can do localhost:3000 in the webbrowser.

In the public folder you can create a hello.html file and write some html codes. Then go to the webbrowser and
do localhost:3000/hello.html to see that html document.
This is one way to create a static webpage in rails.

Now the second way:

We will have pages like home, contact, about. So we will also create a controller to control all the pages.
DO
rails generate Pages home contact

Now you should be able to see a pages_controlller.rb file in the app>controllers
Also check the views in the app folder, you should see the pages folder with home.html.erb and contact.html.erb

See the mvc_detailed.jpg and also see the routes.rb file in the config folder. You should see the   
get 'pages/home'  
get 'pages/contact' in the file

If you go to http://localhost:3000/pages/home then it should give something back in the browser.





Chapter 3: 17
Now we are going to add a new page called about in the project using TDD.
TDD is like writing test code before writing the application.

Just for the proference I am deleting files as
git rm -r spec/views
git rm -r spec/helpers
-r is for recursive


then to do TDD, do rspec/spec
In order to speed up the TDD, we are using spork

http://www.rubyinside.com/how-to-rails-3-and-rspec-2-4336.html

autotest

In the pages_controller_spec.rb file if we add a test for about pages as
describe "GET about" do
    it "returns http success" do
      get :about
      expect(response).to have_http_status(:success)
    end
  end

   and do the rspec/spec then it will give error saying there is no route to the about page. Ok.
   SO now add the routes to about page in the routes.rb and do the rspec again. Now there will be different error saying
   no action to the about page. SO we define action to about page in the controllers > pages_controller.rb as
  def about
  end

  Now run the rspec again. There is a new error saying missing template pages/about i.e. views
  See there is not about.html.erb file in the views.SO I need to create one named about.html.erb
  and you can put anything you like in that about.html.erb page

  Now if you do the rspec/spec it will have no error. 
  Conclusion: To add a new page you will have to configure it in routes.rb to give route (see the mvc_detailed .jpg), then 
  we will need configure the controller in pages_controller.rb and finally need to configure the views by adding about.html.erb
  file. (ROUTES--CONTROLLER--VIEWS) See the mvc_detailed.jpg makes sense.
  Here rspec is helping us to do the test.
  You can now also do the localhost:3000/pages/about






  Chapter 3: Slightly Dymanic Pages
  As of now all the home, about and contact pages have the same tile (Sample App). We will now change it to the specific name.
  SO we add a test in the spec file as 
    describe "GET home" do
    it "returns http success" do
      get :home
      expect(response).to have_http_status(:success)
    end

    it "should have the right title" do
      get :home
      response.should have_selector("title", 
                      :content => "Ruby On Rails Tutorial Sample App | Home")
  end
end

and do the rspec. It will fail. SO add the title in the home page and run the spec. It will fail again 
becasue we deleted a view spec so need to add the following code in the spec file as

require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe PagesController, :type => :controller do
  render_views
  .... so other codes



Even though we change the title of the pages we will still get the same Sample App title. Go to the localhost:3000/pages/home
and do Ctrl + U, you will see the two title. By default rails generate the other title. That file is in views > Layouts. Check that. It is coming from there.


Now all the home, contact and about page has same code in the head only minor changes in the title and the body. Duplication in the views.

Now it is interesting, in the pages_controller, we add
class PagesController < ApplicationController
  def home
  	@title ="Home"
  end
  ....

  and then in the home.html.erb we make the thing dynamic as:
  <head>
		<title>Ruby On Rails Tutorial Sample App | <%= @title%></title>
	</head>

	<%= %> will insert the content of the varibale as <%= @title %>

Now let's put all the common code in the application.html.erb as:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Ruby On Rails | <%= @title %></title>
		<%= csrf_meta_tag%> // add this line for cross site request forgery
							// this will prevent attacks to your website
	</head>

	<body>
		<%= yield %>
	</body>
</html>
 
 Here <%= yield %> will pull contents from the home, about and the contact pages.
 Now in the home, about and contact we willhave only,
 		<h1>This is the home Page for Ruby on Rails</h1>
		<p>Hey Kushal How is it going?</p>


http://www.rubular.com/    you can check the regular expression here.

Below is the code to test if the body is empty or not i.e, checking if <%=yeild%> is working or not
 it "should not have empty body" do
    get :home
    response.body.should_not =~/<body>\s*<\/body>/
  end

Run the rspec and it will pass once you do the yield thing.  
<body>\s*<\/body> was generated from the rubular.com



Chapter 4: Adding Styles

We will include the CSS, Learn little bit of Ruby and OOPs
If we delete the <%=@title %> in say, home.html.erb then it will only give the half of the title. We have a generic 
title in the helper file in the app > helper > application_helper.rb or pages_helper.rb. Both are like same in this case.

module ApplicationHelper

	 #Return a title on a per page
	 def title
	 	base_title ="RoR Sample"
	 	if @title.nil?
	 		base_title
	 	else
	 		"#{base_title} | #{@title}"
	 		// OR "Ruby On Rails | #{@title}"
	 	end
	 end
end

And we will need to change the application.html.erb file as
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title><%=title%></title>  // no @ sign this time
		<%= csrf_meta_tag%>
	</head>

	<body>
		<%= yield %>
	</body>
</html>


If I delete the 
def contact
  	@title ="Contact" //delete this line
  end
Then the title will be RoR Sample else Ruby On Rails | Contact


http://blueprintcss.org/ is the CSS framework that cuts down the development time


Add this code to the app>Initializer>assets.rb
Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w( blueprint/screen.css )
Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w( blueprint/print.css)

Then add
<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'blueprint/screen', :media=> 'screen'%>
<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'blueprint/print', :media=> 'print'%> in the head of the application.html.erb

then copy the blueprint folder to the app\assets\stylesheets and restart the server
Then it should give you the styles according to the blueprint


Now we will focus on the basic Ruby syntax:
__________________________________________________



do rails c for opening the rails console.

"" #empty string
"Kushal"  # non empty string
"kushal" + "Pradhan" is allowed to concatenate strings
"foo".concat("bar") is also allowed

first ="Kushal"
"#{first} Pradhan" will return Kushal Pradhan
last ="Pradhan"

"#{first} #{last}" will return Kushal Pradhan
This is called string interpolation

We can also do first + " " + last

We did the same in "#{base_title} | #{@title}"


puts is the command to print.
We can do puts "Kushal"
We can do print first


Single quotated string:

In the console,
"foo\n" will give "foo\n"
'foo\n' will give "foo\\n"

\n refers to the new line whiel ' ' will give \ and a new line
Single quotes will not interpolate the strings like the double quotes.

we can do:

	"Kushal".length will give 6
	"Kushal".empty? will return false

s="kushal"
if s.empty?
	"Empty"
else
	"not empty"


x="foo"
y=""
puts "Both strings empty" if x.empty? && y.empty?
puts "one strings empty" if x.empty? || y.empty?

if x.empty? && y.empty?
	puts "both empty"
end

puts "x is not empty" if !x.empty?  is same as
puts "x is not empty" unless x.empty?

to_s method is like toString method
nil.to_s will give ""

nil.to_s.empty? will return true.


"".empty? is true
" ".empty? is false

first.class will return which class it belongs..it will return String

nil is the only object that is false by default other than false
if nil
	"TRUE"
else
	"FALSE"


	This will return false. 0 is TRUE

To get the boolean of any thing use bang bang as
!!nil  is false
!!0    is true


Method Definition:

def string_message(something_crazy)
	if something_crazy.nil?
		"It's nil"
	else
		It's something
	end	
end

then we can all it as

string_message("") will give It's something
string_message(nil) will give It's nil
string_message(puts "foobar") will give It's nil
because
puts "foobar" will display foobar and give nil so..


module is a group of methods or function.


Other Datastructures:
<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'blueprint/screen', :media=> 'screen'%>

Here  :media=> 'screen' is a hash. 

Array:
"foo bar    baz".split
 will give an array of strings as ["foo", "bar", "baz"]

 We can also use "fooxxbarxxbax".split("xx")
 Array can have anything.
 a=[42,6,54]
 a[0] is 42 and so on
 a[-1] is allowed and wraps around from the other side and is 54 here

 a.first is allowed is 42
 a.second is allowed is 6
 a.last is allowed is 42
 a.length is 3
 a.empty? is false
 a==[42,6,54] will give TRUE

 google ruby api for details

 a.sort will just show the sorted array but doesn't modify the array
 to modify tha array as well we need to do is a.sort!
 similarly, a.reverse!, a.shuffle!

 Range:
 1..23
 (1..23).to_a will give array with numbers from 1 to 23. to_a will convert
 to array.


 a<<9 will add 9 at last
 we can mix data types in array

 we can do a<<"foo"
 	or we can do like a<<(1..5)
We can put anything in array

a<<%w[foo bar baz] we are putting another array in a array 

Enumerable:
(1..5).each {|i| puts 2**i} will give
2
4
8
16
32
This is like for each loop


We can do like:

	a=[]
	(1..5).each{|i| a<<i} we have initialized the empty array.

We can also do like
	(1..5).map(|i| 2**i)
We can also denote the block as:

(1..5).map do |i|
	2**i
end


We can also do like:
	3.times do 
		puts "Kushal"
	end
	which will display Kushal 3 times

%(a b c) will double quote a b c as "a b c"

%w[a b c]  is the shorthand for ["a", "b", "c"]

we can also do like:

	%w[a b c].map{|string| string.upcase}
	will return ["A", "B", "C"]

	%w[a b c].map{|char| char.upcase}
	or Even
	%w[a b c].map{|kpp| kpp.upcase}

	A compact way to do the same thing is
		%w[a b c].map(&:upcase)


:something What is this colon thing?

How to define hash?
user = {}  this is an empty hash.. this is different from the curly 
braces from the blocks

Array are indexed by intergers while hash can be indexed using anything. 
Hashes do not have orders.
	user ={ "first" => "Kushal", "last" => "Pradhan" }
	key value pair
user ={:first =>"kushal", :last=>"Pradhan"}
	here we are using symbols as keys instead of strings

differene between symbols and strings:

"name".split('')
will give ["n", "a", "m", "e"] because as a string name is compressed 
characters
while 
	:name.split('') will give error because it is like one single thing

we can slso do :name.length....symbols can keep track of their length
	symbols can be compared at once unlike strings like 
	s="name"
	s=="name"

symbols will have fast lookup
we can do user[:first]

	we can iterate through the Hashes.

	user.each do |key, value|
		puts "Key #{key.inspect} has value #{value.inspect}"
	end

inspect will present as it is

a=[4,5,6]
puts a will give 4
				 5
				 6

but if I do puts.a.inspect will give [4,5,6]


	<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'blueprint/screen', :media=> 'screen'%>
	is same as doing

	<%= stylesheet_link_tag ('blueprint/screen', {:media=> 'screen'})%>

Inheritance:
we can do like

	s = "foobar"

	s.class  is String
	s.class.superclass is object
	s.class.superclass.superclass is Basic Object and nil above that


Class Word
	def palindrome?(String)
		string == string.reverse
	end
end

w= Word.new
w.palindrome?("level")
TRUE
w.palindrome?("Kushal")
false

OR we can also do like:

	class Word < String // Words inherits from String
		def palindrome
			self= self.reverse
		end
	end

w = Word.new("foobar") will give "foobar"
w.class is Word
w.palindrome?   is false

Blank method:

"   ".empty?   gives false

"    ".blank?  gives true
ni.blank?      gives true



Making Class:

Class user
	attr_accessor :name, :email
	
	def initialize(attributes ={})
		@name = attributes[:name]
		@email = attributes[:email]
	end

	def formatted_email
		"#{@name} <#{@email}>"
	end
end

Now if I add the above code in the new file say, user.rb and put it in 
the  sample_app then I can do like,

	require './user'
	user = User[:name =>"Kushal", :email=>"pkushal@uab.edu"]
	then
	user.name will give Kushal
	user.email will give pkushal@uab.edu

	user.formatted_email will give
		Kushal <pkushal@uab.edu>

Nested Hash:
param ={}
param[:user] ={:name =>"Kushal", :email=>"pkushal@uab.edu"}
//the key user will map to another hash

params will give
{:user => {:name=>"Kushal", :email=>"pkushal@uab.edu"}}

user = User.new(params[:user])


If I do base_title = "Kushal" inside some block then it can only
be accessed inside that block. However, if I do 
@base_title="Kushal" it will be an instance varibale and can be 
accessed outside of the block as well
