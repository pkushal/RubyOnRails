rails new sample_app -T // this -T will prevent rails from creating the test directory as we
want to use our own testing thing

Make changes to your gem file if you need to
In this project, I added

group :development do
	gem 'rspec-rails', '3.1.0'
end


group :test do
	gem 'rspec', '3.1.0'
end

to the gem file



Then run bundle install
rails generate rspec:install  // to install some file for rspec

Now edit the .gitignore file as required and do the git.

In the new cmd, do rails s to run the server so that you can do localhost:3000 in the webbrowser.

In the public folder you can create a hello.html file and write some html codes. Then go to the webbrowser and
do localhost:3000/hello.html to see that html document.
This is one way to create a static webpage in rails.

Now the second way:

We will have pages like home, contact, about. So we will also create a controller to control all the pages.
DO
rails generate Pages home contact

Now you should be able to see a pages_controlller.rb file in the app>controllers
Also check the views in the app folder, you should see the pages folder with home.html.erb and contact.html.erb

See the mvc_detailed.jpg and also see the routes.rb file in the config folder. You should see the   
get 'pages/home'  
get 'pages/contact' in the file

If you go to http://localhost:3000/pages/home then it should give something back in the browser.
